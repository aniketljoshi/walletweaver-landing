# WalletWeaver — About

### Headline
**Making On-Chain Data Actionable**

### Subheadline
WalletWeaver is the on-chain intelligence platform that transforms raw blockchain data into wallet clusters, entity profiles, and smart-money signals.

## Our Mission

Blockchain data is public, but insight is not.

Every day, billions of dollars flow across public blockchains — yet understanding *who* is moving that capital remains remarkably difficult. Addresses are pseudonymous. Entities fragment across wallets. Signal drowns in noise.

WalletWeaver exists to close this gap.

We believe every serious participant in crypto markets deserves access to institutional-grade on-chain intelligence. Not just block explorers. Not just token charts. But real understanding of the entities, behaviors, and capital flows that shape markets.

Our platform combines real-time blockchain indexing, machine learning-powered entity resolution, and enterprise infrastructure to deliver this intelligence through a single API. Whether you're a solo trader, a hedge fund, a protocol team, or a compliance department — WalletWeaver gives you the visibility you need.

## What We've Built

### Multi-Chain Indexing
Real-time data ingestion across Ethereum, Solana, Base, Arbitrum, and Polygon. Kafka-powered pipelines process millions of events daily with sub-second latency.

### Entity Resolution Engine
Proprietary ML models cluster wallet addresses into real-world entities. Going beyond simple heuristics, our algorithms identify the patterns that reveal who controls what.

### Smart-Money Scoring
Continuously-updated scoring models rank wallets by historical performance. ROI, win rate, timing, conviction — quantified and queryable.

### Production API
GraphQL-first architecture with SDKs for TypeScript, Python, and Go. Built for production workloads with 99.9% uptime and enterprise-grade security.

### Real-Time Alerts
Instant notifications via Telegram, Discord, Email, or Webhooks. Never miss a move from the wallets that matter.

## Our Values

### Build for Production
We don't ship demos. Every feature is designed for real-world, production workloads. Reliability, performance, and security are non-negotiable.

### API-First
We believe intelligence should be programmable. Our API is the product — everything else is just documentation.

### Privacy-Respecting
We help users understand public blockchain data. We do not collect or sell personal information. We do not deanonymize individuals.

### Transparent Methodology
Our scoring models, clustering algorithms, and data sources are documented. Trust is earned through transparency.
